## Good to know

Declear let variable with no default value. Add a type to it (let number1: number;). Otherwise do
NOT declear datatype. It could be reduntant later and it is not best practice.

Tuples are made for arrays with strict number of indexes. And so you can customize the datatypes so
that you get the same datatypes input every time. The push metod is allowed for Tuples.
